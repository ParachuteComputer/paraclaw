# parachute-agent Security Model

## Trust Model

| Entity | Trust Level | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Main group | Trusted | Private self-chat, admin control |
| Non-main groups | Untrusted | Other users may be malicious |
| Container agents | Sandboxed | Isolated execution environment |
| Incoming messages | User input | Potential prompt injection |

## Security Boundaries

### 1. Container Isolation (Primary Boundary)

Agents execute in containers (lightweight Linux VMs), providing:
- **Process isolation** - Container processes cannot affect the host
- **Filesystem isolation** - Only explicitly mounted directories are visible
- **Non-root execution** - Runs as unprivileged `node` user (uid 1000)
- **Ephemeral containers** - Fresh environment per invocation (`--rm`)

This is the primary security boundary. Rather than relying on application-level permission checks, the attack surface is limited by what's mounted.

### 2. Mount Security

**External Allowlist** - Mount permissions stored at `~/.config/parachute-agent/mount-allowlist.json`, which is:
- Outside project root
- Never mounted into containers
- Cannot be modified by agents

(Pre-0.1.0 installs auto-migrate from `~/.config/paraclaw/` on first 0.1.0 boot. Compat read drops in 0.2.0.)

**Default Blocked Patterns:**
```
.ssh, .gnupg, .aws, .azure, .gcloud, .kube, .docker,
credentials, .env, .netrc, .npmrc, id_rsa, id_ed25519,
private_key, .secret
```

**Protections:**
- Symlink resolution before validation (prevents traversal attacks)
- Container path validation (rejects `..` and absolute paths)
- `nonMainReadOnly` option forces read-only for non-main groups

**Read-Only Project Root:**

The main group's project root is mounted read-only. Writable paths the agent needs (store, group folder, IPC, `.claude/`) are mounted separately. This prevents the agent from modifying host application code (`src/`, `dist/`, `package.json`, etc.) which would bypass the sandbox entirely on next restart. The `store/` directory is mounted read-write so the main agent can access the SQLite database directly.

### 3. Session Isolation

Each group has isolated Claude sessions at `data/sessions/{group}/.claude/`:
- Groups cannot see other groups' conversation history
- Session data includes full message history and file contents read
- Prevents cross-group information disclosure

### 4. IPC Authorization

Messages and task operations are verified against group identity:

| Operation | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Send message to own chat | ✓ | ✓ |
| Send message to other chats | ✓ | ✗ |
| Schedule task for self | ✓ | ✓ |
| Schedule task for others | ✓ | ✗ |
| View all tasks | ✓ | Own only |
| Manage other groups | ✓ | ✗ |

### 5. Credential Isolation (Local Secret Store)

parachute-agent stores third-party credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens) in a local AES-GCM-encrypted store and injects them into per-agent containers as environment variables at spawn time. There is no proxy in the request path — the credential is plaintext inside the container at runtime, the same posture as any standard process environment.

**How it works:**
1. Credentials are written via the `/secrets` page in the parachute-agent web UI (or the `secrets` table directly). Ciphertext lives in the central DB; the master key is at `~/.parachute/agent/master.key` on the host (mode 0600).
2. When parachute-agent spawns a container, it resolves the secrets assigned to that agent group, decrypts them on the host, and passes them as `-e KEY=VAL` Docker flags.
3. Agents see the credentials as ordinary env vars. The host process is the only thing that ever holds the master key — containers cannot decrypt the ciphertext on their own.

**Per-agent assignment:**
Each agent group has its own assignment list. A "sales" group and a "support" group can hold disjoint sets of credentials. Rotation is a write to the secret row; the next container spawn picks up the new value.

**NOT Mounted:**
- Channel auth sessions (`store/auth/`) — host only
- Mount allowlist — external, never mounted
- Any credentials matching blocked patterns
- `.env` is shadowed with `/dev/null` in the project root mount

## Privilege Comparison

| Capability | Main Group | Non-Main Group |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Project root access | `/workspace/project` (ro) | None |
| Store (SQLite DB) | `/workspace/project/store` (rw) | None |
| Group folder | `/workspace/group` (rw) | `/workspace/group` (rw) |
| Global memory | Implicit via project | `/workspace/global` (ro) |
| Additional mounts | Configurable | Read-only unless allowed |
| Network access | Unrestricted | Unrestricted |
| MCP tools | All | All |

## Supply Chain Security (pnpm)

Paraclaw uses pnpm with two supply chain defenses configured in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

### Minimum Release Age

`minimumReleaseAge: 4320` (3 days). pnpm will refuse to resolve any package version published less than 3 days ago. This defends against typosquatting and compromised maintainer accounts — most malicious publishes are detected and pulled within 72 hours.

**Excluding a package from the release age gate** (`minimumReleaseAgeExclude`):

This should be rare. When a zero-day fix or critical dependency requires an immediate update:

1. The exclusion must be reviewed and approved by a human maintainer
2. The entry must pin the **exact version** being excluded — never a range or wildcard
   ```yaml
   minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
     some-package: "1.2.3"  # Approved by @user, 2026-04-14 — CVE-XXXX-YYYY fix
   ```
3. The exclusion should be removed once the version ages past the threshold (i.e. after 3 days)
4. Automated agents (Claude, CI bots) must never add exclusions without human sign-off

### Build Script Allowlist

`onlyBuiltDependencies` restricts which packages can execute install/postinstall scripts. Only packages on this list are permitted to run build scripts during `pnpm install`. Currently allowed:

- `better-sqlite3` — compiles native SQLite bindings
- `esbuild` — downloads platform-specific binary
- `protobufjs` — generates protobuf bindings (used by Baileys/libsignal)
- `sharp` — downloads platform-specific image processing binary

Adding a package to this list requires human approval — build scripts execute arbitrary code with the installing user's permissions.

### `.npmrc` Safety Net

The `.npmrc` file contains `minReleaseAge=3d` as a fallback. The authoritative setting is in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, but `.npmrc` provides defense-in-depth if npm is ever invoked directly (e.g. by a tool that doesn't respect pnpm).
